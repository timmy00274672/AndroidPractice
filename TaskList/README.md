**Tasklist** is a simple to-do list app that mainly demonstrates the use of a custom content provider

## Version 1

- Implement a content provider `TaskListProvider` for accessing and storing data
    + Define some constant in `TaskList` and `TaskList.Task` 
- Main Activity `TaskListActivity` lists all the tasks that have been created
- `TaskDetailActivity` activity shows the detail of each task
