This project consists of many sub-projects.


## part one

discuss

1. the lifecycle of activity and fragment (observe the LogCat)
2. dynamically add fragment to container 
2. using fragment's back stack (compare the two sub-projects in this part)

Sub-projects:

- [Without using BackStack](DynamicAddFragmentToContainerWithoutBackStack)
- [With using BackStack](DynamicAddFragmentToContainerWithBackStack)

## part two

The examples in part one have a problem that in `ArticleFragment#onTextChanged` method Fragment directly use parent Activity. It's not good.

The best practice is to use the Activity as an **intermediary**.This allows the Fragments to be as independent and **loosely coupled** as possible, with the responsibility for deciding how an event in one Fragment should affect the overall UI falling to the host Activity.

Where your Fragment needs to **share events** with its *host Activity* (such as signaling UI selections), itâ€™s good practice to **create a callback interface within the Fragment** that a host Activity must implement.

Sub-projects:

- [Basic](InterfacingBetweenFragmentsAndActivities2)
- [using this knowledge to refactor previous project](InterfacingBetweenFragmentsAndActivities)

NOTE: Now you can see the **ToDoList2**. It use above knowledge to refactor the first version.

## part three

Try **portrait mode**. It's very important topic, that allow app provide different UI in different orientation case.

It's important to read the README file with discussion of *How to work with Fragments*.

Sub-projects:

- [portrait mode](PortaitMode)

## part four

I refactor previous project. Implement the solution with only one activity with multiple Fragments --> **Dynamic** change.

Sub-projects:

- [Fragments](Fragments)

## TODO Topic

- Fragment without UI.
- how to use bundle in fragment
- use retained fragment, and compare the normal one in case of changing host activity's configuration.
